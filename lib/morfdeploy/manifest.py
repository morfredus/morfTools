"""What a project must declare to be installable.

Every install-service.sh in the parc carried the same four steps and differed
only by a service name and a directory. Those two values, plus the handful of
paths around them, are what this manifest holds -- so the algorithm can live in
one place and the project keeps stating its own facts.

The manifest is JSON for the same reason the shared parc configuration is:
neither C++ nor Python is privileged, and a project written in either declares
itself the same way.
