"""Windows backend — x64.

A note on what a Windows service actually requires, because it decides the
shape of this file.

The Service Control Manager does not merely launch a program: it expects the
process to connect back, declare a service entry point and report its state
within about thirty seconds. A binary that does not do this is registered
without complaint by `sc.exe create` and then fails at start with error 1053,
"the service did not respond in a timely fashion". Nothing in that message
mentions the missing SCM handshake.

The morfSystem services are ordinary Qt console programs. They are SCM-aware on
no platform, and making them so would mean adding Windows-specific startup code
to every one of them -- inside programs whose whole point is to be identical
everywhere.

So there are two strategies here, and the manifest chooses:

  "scm"       real Windows service. Requires either an SCM-aware binary or a
              wrapper (WinSW, NSSM) that speaks the protocol on its behalf.
  "task"      scheduled task at boot. What the PowerShell scripts did. Not a
              service: no dependency ordering, no automatic restart on crash,
              and it does not appear in services.msc.

The default is "task" because it is what works today with an unmodified binary.
Declaring "scm" without a wrapper is refused at install time rather than
producing a service registered to fail.
